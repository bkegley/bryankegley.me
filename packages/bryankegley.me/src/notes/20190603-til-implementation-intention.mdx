I've been working my way through the highly recommended 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear. So far, nothing short of all of the glowing reviews. In the short couple of days I've noticed myself 'Pointing and Calling' my habits and starting to understand cue (both good and bad). If you haven't picked up this gem yet I'd highly recommend.

The book centers around the four steps of habits - cue, craving, response, and reward - with each of the four sections illustrating how to maximize each step of habit building. 'Make it obvious' is the statute to invite good habits and shoo away bad ones. By intentionally laying out opportunities for good habits to happen we eliminate the need to be strong-willed. Instead, by making good habits obvious (and bad ones invisible) we find ourselves stumbling into the behaviors we want.

During this section, Clear explains that it's proven that those with a specific implemntation plan are extraordinarily more likely to accomplish the task than those that don't. By setting forth specifics about the implementation we eliminate the hemming and hawing of "Should I go for a run now or after breakfast?".

"I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"

Set forth a specific activity. Set forth a specific time. Set forth a specific location. Reap the rewards.

While short and sweet, this post is the product of "I will write for 30 minutes every night at 8:00pm at the kitchen table." Hey, worked for me.
