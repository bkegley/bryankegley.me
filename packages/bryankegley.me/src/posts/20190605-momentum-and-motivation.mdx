# On a lack of motivation

Motivation is a fickle creature. Rustle the leaves and it'll dart back into hiding before you can even say "David Allen". I'm not really sure how many of my "great" ideas lay resting in their graves because their short-lived lives ended due to a lack of motivation. I'll give you a hint, it's not quite Arlington but it's definitely bigger than that cemetery behind your typical, country, Baptist church.

However, motivation, while seemingly fleeting, once found has a habit of compounding.
Motivation breeds motivation. Like pink eye at a daycare... eh, you can probably finish the simile. Know the feeling? Once you get rollin' everything just flows. Take the recycling out once and before you know it you're scaling Mount Doom.

So what do we do when we're in the lost wandering in the motivation desert? Whence cometh the motivation (or lack therof)?

Often if you're looking for the source of your lack of motivation, look no further than your lack of motivation. The converse of compounding motivation is equally true. Living in the doldrums of an unmotivated life produces more stagnancy and paralysis.

# Stop at the red mailbox

I've recently gotten back in the rhythm of running which has been great for my health and overall mindset. However, today I went running and had issues again with my IT band. While the goal was a 5-miler, once my knee started hurting I immediately began to compromise. After turning the corner a couple of blocks from home I saw a red mailbox. That became the new goal. Instead of running the remaing half mile I'd stop short. "Once I hit that mailbox I'll take a quick break and stretch this out."

Almost immediately after making that compromise I felt the soreness of my legs and the desparation of my breathing. Nothing had actually changed about how tired I was but once I had compromised on the goal my body switched into "I'm tried because I'm almost done" mode and I felt it.

Motivation, that persnickity thing, flees at the sight of compromise. But, flip that pancake over and the opposite is true: hitting goals compounds motivation. When we pass mailbox after mailbox, flying down the street like Prefontaine we become unstoppable.

# What's moving?

"An object in motion remains in motion", so declares Sir Isaac Newton with the converse that "an object at rest remains at rest". Constants, whether change or lack of change, don't change much. One could even so boldly say that they remain constant. If Isaac forgot to fill his fountain pen here we'd be doomed to a dismal, unmotivated world but nay, he writes on:

"...unless acted on by an outside force."

Everything that moves, moves and that which rests, rests. Unless something else acts on it.

# Start starting and find what's started

I'm no physicist but I've seen an apple tree before so I'm pretty sure that qualifies me for making some outlandish assertions.

So, start starting. And once you're going, go. Once you start, the goings-on of going on are inevitable. Just ask Sir Isaac.
