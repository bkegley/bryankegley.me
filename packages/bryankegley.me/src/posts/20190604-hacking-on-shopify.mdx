I've been a Shopify user for a fair amount of time now and have fallen in love with the platform. Coming from the Wordpress/Woocommerce world, Shopify made manages ordering through fulfillment an absolute breeze. However, no platform is perfect and I've definitely experienced mroe than a few hiccups implementing certain features.

Over the years of developing some coding competency I've started to extend the platform a bit more as no solution can completely cover all the edge cases. It started pretty small with synchronizing data with webhooks and upgraded a bit to building an interface to handle some custom fulfillment needs. However, recently, I've started to realize the platform could span outside of a simple ecommerce site and begin to bridge the gap in a full-fledged, user-authenticated web app.
