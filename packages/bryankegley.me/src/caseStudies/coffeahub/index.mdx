<CaseStudySection title="Problem">
  Coffea Roasterie is a growing specialty coffee roaster/retailer in the process of opening a fourth café.
  Growth causes challenges for many businesses but can present unique challenges for small businesses.
  Furthering a geographic presence causes strain to these existing difficulties.
  The primary goal of coffeahub.com is to alleviate the challenges a growing small business faces.

Local companies handle growth with the help of many third-party applications that solve immediate pain-points (sales,
scheduling, POS, etc.). However, over time this leads to redundant data points, increased labor and data entry errors,
and difficulty finding crucial business operations. Coffea Roasterie needed a single platform to consolidate
information across the organization so that they could continue to push forward in the specialty coffee industry.

<CaseStudySection title="Why Microservices?">
  I landed on using a microservices architecture for the project as I would be the only developer on the project. Being
  able to build, test, and maintain isolated units of the backend of the application lowered the cognitive startup time
  for working on the project. Implementation details for each of the various services (authentication, Shopify, Square,
  When I Work, etc.) weren’t important as the project continued. This made adding additional services trivial as the
  scope of the project increased over time.

<CaseStudySection title="Building a GraphQL API">
  Utilizing GraphQL for the project was one of the best decisions for speed and maintainability. The self-documenting
  nature of a GraphQL API made it accessible as a solo developer while developing on different parts of the stack. Like
  the decision to use microservices, utilizing GraphQL allowed the frontend to not be concerned with the implementation
  of data-fetching across various APIs which sped development significantly.
