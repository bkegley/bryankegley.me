It's quite helpful to be able to quickly fire up an application configured specifically for your environment using a single command.
Utilizing multi-stage build and build targets we can accomplish this with Docker.

## Dockerfiles

```Dockerfile
# First install all necessary dependencies as 'install' stage
FROM node:12-alpine3.11 AS install
WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .
COPY yarn.lock .
RUN yarn

COPY . .

# Build and run  the application
FROM node:12-apline3.11 as build
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=install /app /app

RUN yarn build

CMD ["node", "./dist/index.js" ]
EXPOSE 4000
```

## Base docker-compose.yml

The base `docker-compose.yml` file should outline only the basic information of your services. Save all of the special coffiguration for differnet environments.

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  db:
    image: database/image

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    depends_on:
      - db

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
```

## Set up development environment

docker-compose automatically reads from both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` which makes the override file perfect for configuring your development environment.

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  # ignore the db service as it doesn't change

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      # set the target to the install stage to stop the image at this step
      target: install
    # run the development script
    command: "yarn develop"
    # set a volume to listen to file changes for hot reloading
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app

  # frontend is set up similarly as backend
  frontend:
```

Now running `docker-compose up --build -d` will run the application in development mode with hot reloading.
