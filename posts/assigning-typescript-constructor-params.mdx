Have you ever been annoyed at having to type `this.prop = prop` over and over for every constructor param in your TypeScript classes?
You're in luck! I just learned today there's a much easier way.

The following two classes are both valid:

```ts
class Message {
  public text: string;
  private username: string;

  constructor(text: string, username: string) {
    this.text = text;
    this.username = username;
  }

  get message() {
    return this.username + ":" + this.text;
  }
}

class OtherMessage {
  constructor(public text: string, private username: string) {}

  get message() {
    return this.username + ":" + this.text;
  }
}
```
