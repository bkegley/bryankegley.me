title: Getting Started with Neovim
summary:
  Getting neovim configured can be a barrier to getting started. Let's break
  that wall.

## Installation

We're going to be using nvim v0.5 as it's slotted for release in the near future
and offers some extra features we'll make use of. If you don't have it installed
you can find installation instructions
[here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly).

If you'd like to check your config into version control (you should) you'll most
likely want that on your filesystem somewhere other than the default location.
Neovim loads it's config from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/init.lua` (or `init.vim` if
that's your style). `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is often exported as `$HOME` so to
symlink your version-controlled config run:

```sh
ln -sf /absolute/path/to/config $HOME/nvim/init.lua
```

## :help is Helpful

Before we get started on anything, a short PSA.

If your homepage is StackOverflow I've got great news for you: Vim comes
packaged with absoulutely fantastic documentation! If you find yourself using
manpages you'll be right at home with vim's `:help`.

Try to build the habit of `:h question-i-have` into your workflow as having
answers to your question built into you editor will save you a lot of time.
Unfortunately `:h me` is about menus, not fixing my life.

For example, if you struggled with the last step or are still marvelling at my
ability to retain such esoteric knowledge type `:h config`

## Lua

Configuring neovim in lua really doesn't require knowing much lua but makes the
experience much more enjoyable. If you come from the JS ecosystem, the
difference is similar to configuring your project in `.json` files vs.
`.config.js` files. Having the ease and flexibility of functions and variables
makes writing your config a delight.

I suggest learning just enough lua _during_ the process of configuring your
editor instead of spending another weekend learning a language. However, if
you're one who feels like you need to know more
[nvim-lua-guide](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide) has a lot of good
resources.

## Options

Nvim comes out-of-the-box looking a bit plain and certainly not optimized for
your specific preferences. The first first step it making it feel like home is
done through setting options.

Each option is set as either a global, buffer-scoped, or window-scoped (see
`:h lua-vim-options`). These are set with `vim.o`, `vim.bo`, and `vim.wo`
respectively. If you're unsure what scope to use for a specific option
`:h option-name` is your friend.

Below are some sensible defaults. I'm choosing to not describe what each of the
options does to give you a chance to utilize the help pages (no, I'm not just
lazy).

```lua
o.termguicolors = true
o.syntax = 'on'
o.errorbells = false
o.smartcase = true
o.showmode = false
bo.swapfile = false
o.backup = false
o.undodir = vim.fn.stdpath('config') .. '/undodir'
o.undofile = true
o.incsearch = true
o.hidden = true
o.completeopt='menuone,noinsert,noselect'
bo.autoindent = true
bo.smartindent = true

o.tabstop = 2
o.softtabstop = 2
o.shiftwidth = 2
o.expandtab = true
wo.number = true
wo.relativenumber = true
wo.signcolumn = 'yes'
wo.wrap = false
```

## Mappings

Let's get started with mapping your leader (a special key that will prefix the
majority of your custom mappings). We'll map it to `space` here but feel free to
use anything that seems convenient to you. This will allow us to map things like
`<leader>l` to quick actions without polluting global mappings.

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = ' '
```

To learn the basic of mapping let's start with disabling arrow keys (just bite
the bullet now and you'll thank me later) and mapping `jk` (and all my various
typos) to `<ESC>` to make leaving insert mode easier.

We'll write a basic lua function that wraps `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap` (remember
`:h nvim_set_keymap` makes your life easier).

```lua
local key_mapper = function(mode, key, result)
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
    mode,
    key,
    result,
    {noremap = true, silent = true}
  )
end
```

And then add our mappings:

```lua
key_mapper('', '<up>', '<nop>')
key_mapper('', '<down>', '<nop>')
key_mapper('', '<left>', '<nop>')
key_mapper('', '<right>', '<nop>')
key_mapper('i', 'jk', '<ESC>')
key_mapper('i', 'JK', '<ESC>')
key_mapper('i', 'jK', '<ESC>')
key_mapper('v', 'jk', '<ESC>')
key_mapper('v', 'JK', '<ESC>')
key_mapper('v', 'jK', '<ESC>')
```

Now try to use your arrow keys and you'll see they're gloriously disabled! Vim
allows no crutches (not really and you can remove those if you want. But don't.)
We'll leave our mappings there for a bit and revisit once we set up our plugins.

## Plugins

Plugins are additional configurations that you can apply to your editor to add
features and improve your quality of life. Much like you can find a VSCode
extension for just about everything you'd want to do (and probably not want to
do) you can find a vim plugin as well. There are many good plugin managers but
we'll be good nvim'ers and use
[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim). The
[quickstart](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#quickstart) is a quick
way to get started but if you're allergic to links you can install it in the
proper location with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/opt/packer.nvim
```

```lua
local vim = vim

local execute = vim.api.nvim_command
local fn = vim.fn

-- ensure that packer is installed
local install_path = fn.stdpath('data')..'/site/pack/packer/opt/packer.nvim'
if fn.empty(fn.glob(install_path)) > 0 then
	execute('!git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim '..install_path)
    execute 'packadd packer.nvim'
end

vim.cmd('packadd packer.nvim')

local packer = require'packer'
local util = require'packer.util'

packer.init({
  package_root = util.join_paths(vim.fn.stdpath('data'), 'site', 'pack')
})

--- startup and add configure plugins
packer.startup(function()
  local use = use
  -- add you plugins here like:
  -- use 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
  end
)
```

To install plugins run `:PackerCompile` and `:PackerInstall`. However, we
haven't added any plugins yet. Onward!

## Highlighting With Treesitter

0.5 ships with built-in tree-sitter support for improved syntax highlighting.
Typically, syntax highlighting is done through regexes that match on
language-specific strings. Tree-sitter works differently by incrementally
parsing your file into a tree identified by a language grammar. This allows
tree-sitter to efficiently highlight even as your file changes as updates are
only applied ot the diff.

In short, it's fast, precise, and has extra goodies.

We'll add tree-sitter, some fallback highlighting support, and a theme to our
plugins.

```lua
packer.startup(function()
  local use = use

  use 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
  use 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'

  -- these are optional themes but I hear good things about gloombuddy ;)
  -- colorbuddy allows us to run the gloombuddy theme
  use 'tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim'
  use 'bkegley/gloombuddy'

  -- sneaking some formatting in here too
  use {'prettier/vim-prettier', run = 'yarn install' }
  end
)
```

To set the default theme use:

```lua
vim.g.colors_name = 'gloombuddy'
```

And finally configure tree-sitter with:

```lua
local configs = require'nvim-treesitter.configs'

configs.setup {
  ensure_installed = "maintained",
  highlight = {
    enable = true,
  }
}
```

Then to install the parser for a specific language use `:TSInstall {language}`
(languages are tab-completed for ease) and `:TSInstallInfo` to see what parsers
you have installed.

## LSP

v0.5 introduces support for built-in LSP for code completion, go to definition,
semantic renaming, and more! Language Server Protocol is a specific set of
methods that a server/client implement in order to accomplish common editor
actions. You can see a list at `:h lsp-method`.

While there are other plugins to add similar functionality, built-in LSP is
highly customizable and easily satisfies all our needs. We'll get started by
adding a couple plugins to help configure lsp.

```lua
use 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
use 'nvim-lua/completion-nvim'
use 'anott03/nvim-lspinstall'
```

After we've installed our plugins (`:PackerCompile`, `:PackerInstall`) we're
ready to configure lsp:

```lua
local lspconfig = require'lspconfig'
local completion = require'completion'

local function custom_on_attach(client)
  print('Attaching to ' .. client.name)
  completion.on_attach(client)

  setup_diagnostics()
end

local default_config = {
  on_attach = custom_on_attach,
}

-- setup language servers here
lspconfig.tsserver.setup(default_config)
```

You'll notice that out of the box diagnostic errors can be a little obtrusive.
This is where the flexibility of built-in lsp really shines. Each method handler
can be customized. We'll customize the `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` method
below and add it to our `custom_on_attach` function.

```lua
local function setup_diagnostics()
  vim.lsp.handlers["textDocument/publishDiagnostics"] = vim.lsp.with(
    vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_publish_diagnostics, {
      underline = true,
      virtual_text = false,
      signs = true,
      update_in_insert = true,
    }
  )
end


-- add setup_diagnostics() to our custom_on_attach
```

Now that our errors aren't dominating our editor let's set up some mappings to
make accessing functionality easier. As always `:h` is your ally here
(specifically `:h lsp-buf`).

```lua
key_mapper('n', 'gd', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', 'gD', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.declaration()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', 'gi', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.implementation()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', 'gw', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.document_symbol()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', 'gW', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.workspace_symbol()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', 'gr', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.references()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', 'gt', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', 'K', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', '<c-k>', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', '<leader>af', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', '<leader>rn', ':lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>')
```

## Fuzzy Finding

Making the switch to vim changes your workflow pretty significantly. While some
things can be painful at first, you'll quickly adapt and forget your pre-vim
self. One of the biggest changes is the loss of your mouse (a moment of silence
for the mice). While navigating your file tree via mouse is pretty natural it's
not the most efficient with your keyboard. Enter, fuzzy finding.

Fuzzy finding is a powerful way to navigate your project by not only file name,
but also file text, open files, and so much more.

There are a few options for fuzzy finding but telescope.nvim is built to be
tailored to suit your preferences. Let's add it to our plugins:

```lua
use 'nvim-lua/popup.nvim'
use 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
use 'nvim-lua/telescope.nvim'
use 'jremmen/vim-ripgrep'
```

And then some some simple mappings:

```lua
key_mapper('n', '<C-p>', ':lua require"telescope.builtin".find_files()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', '<leader>fs', ':lua require"telescope.builtin".live_grep()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', '<leader>fh', ':lua require"telescope.builtin".help_tags()<CR>')
key_mapper('n', '<leader>fb', ':lua require"telescope.builtin".buffers()<CR>')
```

Congrats! Now you're ready to join the pros!
