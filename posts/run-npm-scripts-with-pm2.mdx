I've had to search for this answer so many times I thought I'd put it up here instead.

```sh
pm2 start npm --name 'My Process' -- run scriptName
```

I run a lot of things in yarn workspaces so I find myself using it frequently like this:

```sh
pm2 start yarn --name 'My Other Process' -- workspace @bjk/package run scriptName
```
