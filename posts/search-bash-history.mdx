Been mashing bash commands in a mad dash to thrash that crash-inducing bug? We've all been there and then in the aftermath of such a session how do we find that one command that fixed everything?

`ctrl+r` provides a pretty nice experience when searching through your bash history but I wanted to give an alternative.

## Use fzf

I was first introduced to `fzf` as a vim fuzzy file finder but learned later that it's uses expand far beyond just vim usage.`fzf` is a fantastic little tool for searching. `fzf` is even more fantastic when you start piping everything to it.

Here's the command:

```sh
cat ~/.bash_history | fzf | sh
```

We `cat` everything to `fzf` which allows us to fuzzy find the command we're looking for and pipe that to `sh` to execute.

Easy.

Peasy.
